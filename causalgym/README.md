This subdirectory of our repository is built on top of the fantastic work of [CausalGym](https://github.com/aryamanarora/causalgym), to which full credit goes to Aryaman Arora et al. 

We add one new file of our own making (`leave_one_out.py`), and otherwise mark any novel contributions of our own needed to run our experiments in the code with `====Modified====` and `====End Modified====`.
